# Tilt-angle-estimation-from-Acclerometer

 This is the matlab file to compute tilt angles from raw accelerometer
 data. During the genration of this code, we computed the tilt angles
 for raw acceleromter data captured by AIM-v2 device. Here the data was
 saved as a bin file. one may re-code the bin file input to csv or any
 data file type inteded. Also, pay attention to the axis of the
 acceleromter. The axis may be prelablled by manifacture. if not, do a
 calibration test determine xyz.
